# Cancer-Classification
Cancer Classification based on Keras API of Tensorflow. 

* Used Wisconsin Breast cancer (diagnostic) dataset to predict whether cancer is Malignant or Benign.
* Used Tensorflow with Keras API to create an ANN model.
* Used Early Stoping and dropout layer to stop overfitting of model and get VAR loss down by 50%.
